# argopm

`argopm` is a package manager for [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/). It enables developers to
distribute and consume argo workflow templates as reusable modules.

Usually, these templates are declared in multiple YAML files and have to be manually applied to the cluster when making
changes, doing this becomes very tedious with a growing number of templates.

That's why we built `argopm`. It allows you to bundle your workflow templates as npm packages so you can distribute and
consume them using the amazing tooling already present in the Javascript ecosystem.

With `argopm` you can also add other k8s resources like configmaps, secrets etc to your package. It also supports adding
grafana dashboards right into your package. There is also support for uploading static files to the artifactory (
available for AWS S3)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js `> v16.9.0`

### Installation

`argopm` is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argopm). You can install it globally in your node
environment using `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm i -g argopm
```

OR

```bash
yarn add -g argopm
```

### Quickstart

To create a new package with `argopm`, create a directory for your package, `cd` into that directory and
run `argopm init .` to scaffold a default package.

```bash
mkdir sample-package && cd sample-package
argopm init .
```

Once this succeeds, you'll see the following contents in your package

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── configmaps
│   ├── README.md
│   └── default.yaml
├── cronworkflows
│   ├── README.md
│   └── default.yaml
├── dashboards
│   └── grafana
│       └── observability.json
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── pipelines
│   ├── README.md
│   └── default.yaml
├── secrets
│   ├── README.md
│   └── default.yaml
├── static
│   ├── README.md
│   └── data.json
└── templates
    ├── README.md
    └── default.yaml

8 directories, 16 files
```

You can then run `argopm install .` to install this package to the kubernetes cluster your current context is set to.
